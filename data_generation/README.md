# Data generation

All credit goes to the creators of the [Baby AI Shape Datasets](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/BabyAIShapesDatasets)

## Incompatibility

The data generation algorithm was copied from the Baby AI Shape Dataset which uses python 2. The foreground extraction code uses python 3. <b>To generate data, use generate_data.py from the root directory.<b>
